# HashCode-2019


we scored 285,563 at the comp-soc hub in appleton tower. 

#### Things I think we did well:
* Scored pretty well considering it was the first time Michael had done any sort of competetive programming and it was our first time working as a team. 
* All did well in our own implicit roles, if the competition were individual then i think we would've done even better than we did.

#### Things to work on:
* Integrating our work together; I feel like i was too caught up in solving bugs with my own code and leaving the others to their sections so that when they had written code it wasn't so easy to combine because we had different implementation plans
* Spend more time conceptually as a team so we're all on the same 'page', I think i wrongly delegated the conceptual ideas for solving to the other two when it should've been a responsibility as a team.
* Stop worrying about code quality as much, i spend too long writing things like getters and setters when i should've worried about other more pressing things
